    "A LangChain Q&A workflow using a locally hosted LLM that can query Wikidata for up-to-date facts and incorporate them into a generated response.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accesses data via the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint to support inference \n",
    "- Supports return of implicit facts in the dataset not explicitly on individual records\n",
    "- Defines a narrow scope of functionality in order to deal with the wide ranging schema of Wikidata content\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise builds on the `local-wikidata-agent-1.ipynb` exercise, significantly simplifying and streamlining the agent architecture in order to constrain the LLM to relevant outputs that lead to a response to the user query.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Abandons LangGraph for a simpler, more straightforward LangGraph implementation\n",
    "- Forces individual evaluation of query parameters (evaluations are run in parallel)\n",
    "- Refines prompts for each query parameter and provides few-shot examples to prime expected responses \n",
    "- Removes the LLM's direct access to the query tool, which runs as an undecorated function\n",
    "- Provides a final \"response\" agent with a set of facts returned from the knowledge graph and interleaved in a system prompt along with the initial user query\n",

    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "- The addition of few-shot examples dramatically increased the accuracy of query parameter returns\n",
    "- 5/8 responses that matched the accuracy of the GPT-4o Mini run model\n",
    "- 1 response that returned a correct \"not available\" response when asked to infer knowledge not present about the continent on which a given country is located\n",
    "- 2 responses which, while _wrong_, were _consistently_ wrong in light of the facts accurately returned from the knowledge graph\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaways\n",
    "- \"Deskilling\" is continuum: some tasks could be deskilled even further to NLP or RegEx (for example the \"award\" parameter), eliminating the need for the LLM for those altogether\n",
    "- Error checking and validation through the chain (or as a graph) could further improve the quality and reliability of these responses\n",
    "- The facts returned could be converted to an in-memory vector store to aid in the final response (especially for more complex queries)\n",
    "- Like users, different models have different strengths. A range of \"usability\" techniques may be the most viable approach to ensuring the fungibility of models across contexts. \n"
